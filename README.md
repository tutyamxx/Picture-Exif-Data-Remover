# How to

1. Upload a photo taken with a smart device
2. Remove the [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data (GPS location etc) from your photo by clicking the `Remove EXIF Data` button
3. It will prompt a download with the same file name and type, but without the pesky EXIF data.
4. Save it to your device
5. Check if there is any EXIF data left using this [EXIF Data Viewer](https://exifdata.com/index.php)

**You need both of these applications to run in the same time (Vue App and the Server) in order to work!**

# How to run (please make sure you followed [this guide](https://github.com/tutyamxx/Picture-Exif-Data-Remover/blob/master/README.md#installation))

| Command  | Information |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| npm run start  | Starts the front end app and the server in the same time  |

# Installation

```

### Compiles and minifies for production (use this only when you are using it for production deployment)
