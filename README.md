* Still a work in progress, but it works fine for now
* Upload a photo taken with a smart device
* Remove the [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data from your photo clicking *Remove EXIF Data* button
* It will prompt a download with the fresh cleaned photo
* Save it to your device

* **You need both of these applications to run in the same time (vue app and server) in order to work!

# For Vue Front End App
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```

```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).


# For Express server

## Server setup
```
npm install
```

## Run server
```
node index.js
```

It will display a console log with the following message if it's running `Server runs and is listening on port 5000.`
