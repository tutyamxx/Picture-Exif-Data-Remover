# How to

1. Upload a photo taken with a smart device
2. Remove the [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data (GPS location etc) from your photo by clicking the `Remove EXIF Data` button
3. It will prompt a download with the same file name and type, but without the pesky EXIF data.
4. Save it to your device
5. Check if there is any EXIF data left using this [EXIF Data Viewer](https://exifdata.com/index.php)
